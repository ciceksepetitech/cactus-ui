# Accordion

<HeaderTableContainer data={accordion} />

## Content

<InfoContainer>
  An accordion is a vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each
  contain a title, content snippet, or thumbnail representing a section of
  content. The headings function as controls that enable users to reveal or hide
  their associated sections of content. Accordions are commonly used to reduce
  the need to scroll when presenting multiple sections of content on a single
  page.

</InfoContainer>

> An accordion element consists of an `AccordionHeader` that has `AccordionButton` inside itself and `AccordionContent` that keep your content. Cactus UI provides `Accordion` component to group them.
